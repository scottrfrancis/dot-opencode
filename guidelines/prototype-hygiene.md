# Prototype Hygiene — Shipping Clean from Day One

Rules learned from the Librarian genericization (2026-03-06). A prototype built against a real use case will ship — and whatever's hardcoded ships with it.

## Rule 1: Deployment Details Are Config Values, Not Code Values

**If it's specific to the deployment, it goes in `.env` or config — never in source code, system prompts, or architecture docs.**

No exceptions, even for "we'll fix it later."

Examples of deployment details:
- IP addresses, hostnames, ports
- Model names and versions (`qwen3:30b`, `gpt-4o`, etc.)
- User names, family names, company names
- File paths specific to the target machine
- SMB/NFS share paths, database names
- API keys, credentials (obviously)

✅ **Do this:**
```python
CHAT_MODEL = os.getenv("CHAT_MODEL", "")  # Set in .env
SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a document assistant..."  # Generic
```

❌ **Not this:**
```python
CHAT_MODEL = os.getenv("CHAT_MODEL", "qwen3.5:27b")  # Hardcoded default
SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are the Francis family's document assistant..."  # Personal
```

The concrete use case belongs in `.env`, `reference/` data files, or deployment-specific config. The codebase stays generic and reusable.

## Rule 2: Docs Describe How and Why, Not What's Currently Running

**Documentation that contains state (current model, current counts, current IPs) is guaranteed to go stale.**

Docs that describe *patterns* (how VRAM contention works, why Option C beats Option A) stay accurate. Docs that describe *state* (15 documents indexed, using qwen3:30b) are wrong by next week.

✅ **Do this:**
- "The API retrieves top-K chunks via cosine similarity" (pattern — stable)
- "Check `GET /stats` for current document counts" (pointer to live state)
- "Configure the chat model via `LIBRARIAN_CHAT_MODEL` env var" (reference to config)

❌ **Not this:**
- "Currently 38 documents indexed with 307 chunks" (stale tomorrow)
- "Uses qwen3:30b for generation" (changed last week)
- "Running on 192.168.7.237" (meaningless to anyone else)

Current state belongs in health endpoints, status commands, and dashboards — not prose.

## Rule 3: Code That Isn't in a PR Doesn't Exist

**The commit isn't the deliverable — the PR is.**

Work on a branch with 16 commits, pushed to origin, that never gets a PR opened is invisible work. Invisible work is unfinished work.

- Commit → Push → **Open PR** → that's the deliverable
- Don't let branches sit. If the work is done, the PR should exist.
- If the work isn't ready for review, open a draft PR — still more visible than a branch.

## Rule 4: Fail Loud — Silent Skips Are Lies

**"Completed" is wrong if anything was silently skipped.**

The shipped-prototype failure mode: a migration logs `completed successfully` after dropping 14% of rows on constraint violations, found 11 days later. A test suite reports `all tests pass` when 18 were marked `skip`. A deploy reports green when one of three regions failed. The error was logged, just not surfaced.

- **A migration that skipped rows did not complete.** Report the count, the reason, and the affected IDs.
- **"Tests pass" requires every test to have run.** If any were skipped, the headline is "ran with skips," not "pass."
- **A script that swallowed an error and moved on did not succeed.** Use `set -euo pipefail`, check return codes, propagate failures.
- **Default to surfacing uncertainty.** "I'm not sure if the cache invalidated" is a useful sentence. "Cache invalidated" when you're not sure is tomorrow's production bug report.

**The test:** for any operation you call "done," what's the smallest piece of work that could have silently failed inside it, and where in your output does that show up? If the answer is "nowhere," the report is wrong.

## Meta-Lesson

The gap between "working" and "shipped" is where quality dies. Working code with hardcoded details, stale docs, and unopened PRs is a prototype pretending to be a product. The genericization pass is the cost of not doing it right the first time.

**Apply these rules from the first commit, not the first refactor.**
