description: Generate draft Gherkin scenarios from a requirement description or FR-### ID

# Gherkin Scenario Generator

**Arguments:** text after `/gherkin` is a requirement description or an `FR-###`
ID (e.g. `/gherkin FR-5.14: users can export a report as CSV`).

## When to Use

- Converting a requirement into testable acceptance criteria
- Expanding coverage for an existing feature file
- Starting a new feature file from a pain point or user story
- Bridging discovery findings into executable specifications

## Instructions

### 1. Learn the project conventions

Read existing feature files to establish patterns. Check these locations in order:

- `docs/requirements/*.feature`
- `docs/specs/**/*.feature`
- `docs/internal/features/**/*.feature`

From existing files, extract:
- **Tag patterns**: `@fr-###`, `@mvp`, `@future-*`, `@draft`, milestone tags
- **Persona names**: used in Given steps (e.g. "the Operator", "the Reviewer")
- **Domain vocabulary**: consistent terminology for When/Then steps
- **Background patterns**: common preconditions used across features

If no existing feature files are found, use generic BDD conventions.

### 2. Locate the requirement

If the input references an FR-### ID, search for the requirement definition in:
- `docs/design/SRS.md`
- `docs/deliverables/D1.7*`
- `docs/deliverables/*Requirements*`

If the input is a plain-language description, use it directly.

### 3. Generate scenarios

For each requirement, generate:

**Feature header**:
```gherkin
Feature: [Descriptive name]
  As a [persona from project conventions]
  I want [capability addressing the requirement]
  So that [business value / pain point resolution]
```

**Background** (if applicable):
```gherkin
  Background:
    Given [common precondition for all scenarios in this feature]
```

**Scenarios** (generate 3-6):
1. **Happy path** — the primary success case
2. **Variation** — a different valid input or path
3. **Edge case** — boundary condition or unusual but valid input
4. **Error/validation** — invalid input, missing data, or permission denied
5. **State transition** (if applicable) — system state changes
6. **Authorization** (if applicable) — role-based access

### 4. Apply tags

Every scenario MUST have:
- `@fr-X.X` — the requirement ID (from input or assigned next available)
- `@draft` — marks as unreviewed
- Milestone tag (`@mvp` or `@future-*`) — infer from context, default to `@mvp`
- Source tag if from an interview: `@source-[name]`

### 5. Use declarative steps

Write steps that describe WHAT happens, not HOW:

**Good**:
```gherkin
Given the analyst is viewing the reports dashboard
When they request a CSV export of the current view
Then the report is downloaded with all visible columns
```

**Bad**:
```gherkin
Given the user opens Chrome and navigates to localhost:3001
When the user clicks the button with id "export-btn"
Then a file appears in the Downloads folder
```

### 6. Place the output

- If adding to an existing feature file, append scenarios after the last existing scenario
- If creating a new feature file, save to `docs/requirements/[topic]-draft.feature`
- Never modify scenarios that don't have the `@draft` tag

## Verification

- [ ] All scenarios have `@fr-*` tags
- [ ] Feature file has Feature: header with As/I want/So that
- [ ] Steps use domain vocabulary consistent with existing features
- [ ] No duplicate scenarios with existing feature files
- [ ] Declarative steps throughout (no UI implementation details)
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are covered, not just happy paths

## Example Invocation

```
/gherkin FR-5.14: the report detail panel shows record counts by type with a status breakdown
```
